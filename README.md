# Project DESCRIPTION
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Ruchita Yadav and this is my personal portfolio,containing info about my skills, contact and the services I provide related to tech industry made using the tech stacks mentioned below.

In this project I have used VScode for writing my code. I have used HTML and styled it with CSS, further I have deployed this project using github on Microsoft Azure with the help of azure web apps by creating a resource group selecting the app service plan for my app .I have also created a chatbot using AI TOOLS provided by Microsoft Azure that is QnA maker and made a web app bot attaching it to my portfolio contact page for my website to be more user friendly. 

# BENEFITS OF PORTFOLIO WEBSITE:
The most important tool that you have to market your work is a portfolio website. With a portfolio website, potential clients from around the world can review the  products and understand the services at their convenience. A well-crafted portfolio of unique projects, impactful campaigns and demonstrated achievements offers organisations a great opportunity to differentiate their brand. Following the best practices, the organisation can improve online visibility and cultivate credibility to capture the interest of B2B clients.

# BENEFITS OF AI CHAT BOT:
Faster and efficient method to provide information to the customers. 
Exceptionally fast exchange of customer problems and solutions.
Easy and least time consuming.
Many simultaneous  users  can communicate with the chatbot.
The chatbot will be available anytime for the customer. 
Increase in productivity and growth of the organization.

# CONNECTING WITH CUSTOMERS:
One of the key benefits of having a portfolio website is that it allows you to have more direct contact with potential clients and visitors to your site. Free tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see where your website visitors are coming from, how they are finding you, and what parts of your website they are spending the most time on.


Portfolio is like an identity card from which people can get to know ones information and get connected for work related queries.
